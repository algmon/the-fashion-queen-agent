## agent technical aspects
## unified framework for both hardware and software - a conceptual model
* ROS and Genesis for simulation

## unified framework for internal and external - a conceptual model
* Tools such as sequential models, neural network etc to simulate the perception, planning and actions in fashion env

## unified framework for agents with env - a conceptual model
* Tools to communicate for collaboration and competition
* Be harmony and be respected to the env
* Learning from the env

## unified framework for live and beauty - a conceptual model
* Beyond phisical, there is beauty.
* pruning
