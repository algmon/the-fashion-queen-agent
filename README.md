# the intelligent AI agent for fashion from Suanfamama
## News
* 2025-02-04 We have our pre-print version of wisdom.graph.py implementation ready
* 2025-02-03 We have our pre-print version of paper ready titled Improved Methods for AI Agent Pruning

## AI agent goal
* the core task is to CAPTURE the beauty and SHARE them with the beloved ones for fashion

## AI agent outcome showcase
![](./showcase/1.png)
![](./showcase/2.png)

## AI agent technical aspect
### unified framework for both hardware and software
* ROS and Genesis for simulation

### unified framework for internal and external
* Tools such as sequential models, neural network etc to simulate the perception, planning, reasoning and action space in env for fashion

### unified framework for agents with env
* Agents to communicate for collaboration and competition
* learning from the env

### unified framework for basic living and advanced beauty appreciation
* Beyond basic living, there is beauty.

### code
